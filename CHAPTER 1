The Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) identifies Six Key Components of any organization. 

==> VISION
The more clearly everyone can see your vision, the likelier you are to achieve it.
Focus everyone’s energy toward one thing and amazing results will follow.

==> PEOPLE
The right people in the right seats.
Once you have the right structure in place, you’ll be able to focus on putting the right people in the right seats. 

==> DATA
A Scorecard is a weekly report containing five to 15 high-level numbers for the organization. 
A Scorecard allows you to monitor your business no matter where you are. 

==> ISSUES
Issues are the obstacles that must be faced to execute your vision.
One helpful by-product of strengthening the first three EOS components is transparency. 

==> PROCESS
Your processes are your Way of doing business. Successful organizations see their Way clearly and constantly refine it.
By deciding what the process is and training everyone to follow it, you will enhance your troubleshooting abilities, 
reduce your errors, improve efficiency, and increase your bottom line.

==> TRACTION
The most successful business leaders are the ones with traction. They execute well, and they know how to bring focus,
accountability, and discipline to their organization.
"Vision without traction is merely hallucination."
