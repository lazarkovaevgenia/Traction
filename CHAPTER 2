Before you can grow, youâ€™ll need to take a leap of faith.

 You need to change from believing that you are your company and letting it become its own entity.
 With the right vision, structure, and people in place, your company can evolve and realize its full potential.
 
==> To be truly ready for this change, you must be willing to embrace the following four fundamental beliefs:
   1. You must build and maintain a true leadership team.
   2. Hitting the ceiling is inevitable.
   3. You can only run your business on one operating system.
   4. You must be open-minded, growth-oriented, and vulnerable.
   
   
 BUILDING A TRUE LEADERSHIP TEAM
 These leaders all have clear accountabilities and must be able to take initiative over their respective departments.
 Each of your departmental heads should be better than you in his or her respective position. Of course, you will need
 to give them clear expectations and instill a system for effective communication and accountability. 
 
 
 HITTING THE CEILING IS INEVITABLE
